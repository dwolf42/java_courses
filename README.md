# java_courses

An overview, sorted by topics, of the projects and learning tasks that I have
worked on, or am still working on, towards learning the fundamentions of Java.
These were mainly written during courses at JetBrains Adademy [Hyperskill](https://www.hyperskill.org).
Among them, however, is also code that I wrote in the course of tutorials from
other sources, such as YouTube, Reddit or other platforms.
