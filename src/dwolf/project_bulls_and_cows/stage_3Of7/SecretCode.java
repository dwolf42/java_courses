/**
 * ~~Class description~~
 * This class has the task of generating a new secret code of a user-given length, which than has to be guessed in the
 * Bulls and Cows game. In the process, System.nanoTime is utilized to generate a pseudo-random number as a string.
 * The secret code's length must not exceed a length of 10, since longer numbers would lack uniqueness of numbers.
 * The code written here is a pre-requirement for the further game development. For further detail, please read
 * the task description.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * ~~Task description~~
 * Using a predefined secret code doesn't make a fun game. Let's implement the ability to generate a pseudo-random
 * secret number of a given length. If the length is greater than 10, print a warning message and do not
 * generate a number.
 * <p>
 * We suggest you use the following algorithm to generate the numbers:
 * long pseudoRandomNumber = System.nanoTime();
 * This code saves the nanoseconds elapsed since a certain time to the pseudoRandomNumber variable. We can assume
 * that this is a random number. You can generate a secret code by iterating over the pseudoRandomNumber in the
 * reverse order and adding unique digits. If the pseudoRandomNumber lacks the required number of unique digits,
 * call System.nanoTime() again and try to generate the secret code again until you get a satisfactory result.
 * You can use the Character.getNumericValue(char a) method to get an integer representation of a number!
 * <p>
 * Objective
 * In this stage, your program should generate a pseudo-random number of a given length with unique digits and print it.
 * If the length is greater than 10, the program should print a message containing the word Error. The secret code may
 * contain any digits from 0 to 9 but only once. The secret code shouldn't start with a digit 0: for the first digit of
 * the secret code, use digits from 1 to 9.
 * Don't delete your previous work, just move your code to a separate method. You will need it in the future stages.
 * <p>
 * Examples
 * The greater-than symbol followed by a space > represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
 * Example 1
 * > 5
 * The random secret number is 48379.
 * <p>
 * Example 2
 * > 4
 * The random secret number is 5213.
 * <p>
 * Example 3
 * > 11
 * Error: can't generate a secret number with a length of 11 because there aren't enough unique digits.
 * <p>
