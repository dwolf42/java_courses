/**
 * ~~Class description~~
 * Here the game gets initialized and executed. User input will be taken.
 * WARNING: There is no input safety check!
 * Wrong input, like letters instead of numbers will crash the application.
 * The user prompts are located in this class, as well as the determination if the user won the game or another turn is
 * required.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * ~~Task description~~
 * In this stage, you should combine all the previous parts into a simple playable version of the "Bulls and Cows" game.
 * First, prompt the player to input the length of the secret code. The length will determine the difficulty level for
 * the current game session. The program should generate a secret code of the given length. Remember that it should
 * consist of unique numbers.
 * <p>
 * Then, the game starts and the program prompts the player to guess the code. When the player inputs a number, the
 * program should grade it in bulls and cows. The game goes on until the code is guessed, that is, until the number of
 * bulls is equal to the number of digits in the code. When the game ends, the program should finish its execution.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * ~~Objective~~
 * In this stage, your program should:
 * 1. Ask for the length of the secret code and then generate the code.
 * 2. Wait for the user input.
 * 3. Grade the guessing attempt in bulls and cows.
 * 4. If the secret code has been guessed, the program stops; otherwise, return to the second step.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * ~~Examples~~
 * Please, enter the secret code's length:
 * > 4
 * Okay, let's start a game!
 * Turn 1:
 * > 1234
 * Grade: 1 bull and 1 cow
 * Turn 2:
 * > 7354
 * Grade: 2 bulls and 1 cow
 * Turn 3:
 * > 9374
 * Grade: 4 bulls
 * Congratulations! You guessed the secret code.
