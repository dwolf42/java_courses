# rpg

A project to exercise OOP fundamentals.
I really love RPG games, which is the reason why I chose to write a simple RPG myself. It represents my idea of the
basic functions of such a game, like attacking, defending and casting spells.

## Prerequisites to run my Java programs

At this point I assume you already have installed the JDK
(Java Development Kit), as well as the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
In case there is one of them missing, you can get both here:

- [ ] `JDK`: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
- [ ] `JRE`: https://java.com/en/download/

## 1# Compiling a JAVA file:

-   Download all Java files related to the program you are intending to run in
    a new folder on your desktop.
    <br/><br/>
-   Open Windows start menu, type CMD and run it.
    <br/><br/>
-   The standard directory you are currently in is usually<br/>
    `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME` (on Win10 at least).
    <br/><br/>
-   Navigate to the folder you created previously, type<br/>
    `cd Desktop\FOLDER_NAME` into the CMD and hit `enter`.
    <br/><br/>
-   In order to compile your project to bytecode,<br/>
    type `javac FILENAME.java` and, again, hit `enter`.
    <br/><br/>
-   Now you have the `FILENAME.class` in your folder at the desktop.<br/>
    You can check this by typing `dir` into CMD, followed by `enter`.<br/>
    This lists all files inside that folder.

## 2# Running a CLASS file:
-   For the program to be executed, you need to run the file containing the
    `main method`. To do so, you either open each `.java` file by  making a
    `right-click` on the file, choose `Open with...`, select `Notepad`.
    Now look in the first couple of code for a line called
    `public static void main(String[] args) {`.
    <br/><br/>
- Too complicated? I've got your back!<br/>
  Alternatively, you may just run one file after another until you found the
  correct file ;)
  <br/><br/>
- Since you should still be in your folder on the desktop (see step 1#),
  just enter `java FILENAME` and hit `enter`.

## TROUBLE SHOOTING:

Unable to run `javac` or `PATH` entry / `Environment Variable` is missing.
To fix this, `open` Windows start menu and type `environ`, this should be
enough to bring up `Edit the system environment variables` - run it.

-   Go to the `Advanced` tab (top side) and click `Environment Variables…`
    <br/><br/>
-   In the lower part of the upcoming window, you find the `System variables`,
    look for the entry named `Path` (*take care, there is another entry with a similar name*),
    `highlight / single click` it and click `Edit…`
    <br/><br/>
-   There should be a variable called `C:\Program Files\Java` or similar.
    Mine contained something with *Oracle* in it. `Select it` and click `Browse…`
    <br/><br/>
-   Now, navigate to `C:\Program Files\Java\` - select the `Bin` folder -
    hit 4 times `OK`, once  in each window.
    <br/><br/>
-   In case your CMD is open, `close` and `re-open` it. You now can run `javac`.
