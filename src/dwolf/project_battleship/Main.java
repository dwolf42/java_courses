Basically, and ocean consists of quadrants, like 1x1 meters.
* Each quadrant can have a state, like being water, a ship, a hit ship, or a miss.
* In order to know where each quadrant is located on the ocean, it has individual coordinates, like 1,3, 2,5 etc.
* The state is the lowest level of the hierarchy, but contains the most valuable variable.
* The quadrant is the next higher level in the hierarchy,
