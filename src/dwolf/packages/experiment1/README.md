As I learned about packages, how to use and name them.
This guided me the way to properly rename my whole folder or package structure.
I liked it most to learn how to use the import statement
at the beginning of a Java file, to make use of a class and its
features and the advantage of writing the full name of a
class to do the very same thing. It was super exciting to me.

Because of that, you find one of my classes imported by the
import statement at the top, and another imported by its name within the code.
Java's standard class Scanner was a good orientation on how to
properly do so.

In this experiment I access my clock project, to ask for the
time to be input and print it.
I soon recognized that the name I choose for the Display class
was not quite ideal, as I got my self confused by it when I
simply tried to print the current time.

This will remind me in future projects to take more care about
the naming, so the usage of classes and methods will feel more
natural to the person who's working with my code.
