TicTacToe was my 2nd project on Hyperskill, where I learned many important basics about Java, as well as how to adjust
my desire for ideal code to a level appropriate to my skill level. I also learned how important it is to get help from
more experienced coders when I have questions.

In the course of the tutorial, I developed TicTacToe Super and TicTacToe SuperGT, respectively, in two side projects.
In doing so, I implemented my own visions of the game and, especially in SuperGT, used additional ASCII art to enhance
the gameplay experience.

Furthermore, I have built an installer for SuperGT, as well as a Windows EXE file. This allowed me to share the game
with my friends, who could try SuperGT without the need to install Java first.

The two versions can be found at the following links:
